To compile, use the following command: 
g++ -g -o raytracer raytracer.cpp raytracer_functions.cpp 

To run, use the following command: 
./raytracer filepath xres yres

This currently raytraces pixels from the camera to the screen 
and calculates lighting based on the calculatd normal and the 
lights that it can reach. (aka can calculate shadows) Note, 
this is EXTREMELY slow at the moment. Proposed optimizations are
adding a z-buffer (calculating closest point using ndc space, but 
using raytracing to add shadows) if the GPU part can be done fast enough. 

Would recommend trying to render the scene_cube1.txt or scene_cube2.txt. Anything 
with many many faces is very slow.
